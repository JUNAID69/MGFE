## Abstract

+ Nowadays we have to roam around a lot to get a type of environment to fit in. We binge 
search on the internet for some places which can be flexible with the variety and quality 
of food we like to have.
+ This project titled ‚ÄúMeat and Greet Food Exchange‚Äù will be a software-based system that 
will make it more flexible for the working class to make it more to grab some 
entertainment with easily available lavish cuisines.
+ Making it more convenient for the customers with beautiful surroundings and an exciting 
system makes meat and greet a happy-to-go place.


<a id = "objective"></a>

## Objective

+ Trying to create a best End-to-End Solution for a Food/Drinks Ordering App which will be of a great use after Covid19 Pandemic where customers fill unsafe while using a HardCopy Menu.
+ Users no longer have to call a Waiter for Ordering or for doing a Payment.
+ Making the Ordering Drinks Task very Interactive and Innovative by Introducing Dynamic Pricing of Drinks(Prices of drinks change while ordering depending on our Algorithm).

<a id = "Introduction"></a>

## Introduction 

+ The Meat and Greet Food Exchange is a dine-in ordering web application for mobile 
devices which helps people to order food or drinks in a club/restaurant. This software 
will be designed to increase restaurant customer interaction and not make them wait for
the waiter to take their order. 
+ This software will be implementing a stock market theme for ordering food as well as drinks. As in a stock market, more demand means higher 
prices similarly, the software should increase the price of the drink based on its demand.
+ TBSE will ‚Äútrade‚Äù * in food and drinks whilst making sure you have a great exchange 
(of conversation, of course!). Starting with all prices starting at retail prices, the prices of 
your favorite food rise in direct proportion to its consumption over a period of time. 
+ Every increasing peg/pint/shot/glass ordered by a patron increases its value margin, to be 
brought down once again if time is on your side (if orders for the same drink decrease 
over a period of time). Before you gasp in worry, our circuit breaker system will ensure 
that you get the best bang for your buck always (whether your favourite stock is high or 
low).
